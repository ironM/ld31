Robot Dash
==========
##Background Story

Wall-A is a scrapped robot dumpped by human master in a actual trash factory but called "Droid Beadhouse". He needs to use all the stuffs found to repair himself and find his way out from __The Tomb__. (May it a litte bit like The Toy Story?)

##Game settings
In the game Wall-A needs to find battery to keep alive __(Yes, time is limited!)__, find components to repair & upgrade himself. There are some ghost droids who want to catch and destroy Wall-A. Wall-A can fight back with weapons found. Finally, he destroys a boss droid and break out the walls of the trash factory and escapes.
    
The ghost droids will upgrade too.
     
Assume the game is a half hour game in easy mode, but we only have dead mode for players.
